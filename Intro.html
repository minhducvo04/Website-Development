                I am Minh Duc and I am a freshman at De Anza College (CA).
                After my first quarter in college, I have learned to code in Java. Furthermore, I have self-taught HTML, CSS, and Python. 
                Also, I learned from freeCodeCamp about Deep Learning- Machine Learning in PyTorch on Google Colab and built models applying
                Linear Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), and Computer Vision solving problems from sklearn or custom datasets.
                I enjoy studying here at De Anza College (or in the U.S generally) with comfortable and dynamic environments.
                My favorite professor is Ms.Clinchard with her passion and open-mindedness.
                I love De Anza's Competitive Programming Club since the officers weekly created competition for us to participate and train for the ICPC.
                Usually, I will rank about top 5 out of about 15 members and officers always encouraged me that I am just freshman and that I will improve much more in the future.
                I love the club and I am trying everyday to become the leader of the club next year!
                With my love for De Anza, I have created this website to introduce myself and the school.

            <p><h4>
                It was my pleasure to study in High School for the Gifted since I met a lot of good friends who always help me and encourage me to overcome setbacks.
                I was studying in the Math Advance class which includes top 10% in Mathematics students in class '19-'22.
                With some knowledge in Mathematics, my classes were carefully introduced to coding and a lot of us were allured by it.
                I am one of them and started coding (in C++) from scratch. We were participate in competition within Vietnam (like UIT coding contest which was hosted by University of Information Technology (Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam))
                I think that my experience with competitive programming has guided me into my favorite club which is the De Anza's Competitive Programming Club and encouraged me to prepare for the ICPC.
